 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Added the following functionality.
1) Changed the NUM_SECONDS to 20.

2) Take any number of arguments for executables and place each on the
   processes list with a state of NEW. The executables will not require
   arguments themselves.

3) When a SIGALRM arrives, scheduler() will be called; it currently simply
   restarts the idle process. Instead, do the following.
   a) Update the PCB for the process that was interrupted including the
      number of context switches and interrupts it had and changing its
      state from RUNNING to READY.
   b) If there are any NEW processes on processes list, change its state to
      RUNNING, and fork() and execl() it.
   c) If there are no NEW processes, round robin the processes in the
      processes queue that are READY. If no process is READY in the
      list, execute the idle process.

4) When a SIGCHLD arrives notifying that a child has exited, process_done() is
   called. process_done() currently only prints out the PID and the status.
   a) Add the printing of the information in the PCB including the number
      of times it was interrupted, the number of times it was context
      switched (this may be fewer than the interrupts if a process
      becomes the only non-idle process in the ready queue), and the total
      system time the process took.
   b) Change the state to TERMINATED.
   c) Restart the idle process to use the rest of the time slice.
